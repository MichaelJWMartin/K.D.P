My role involved conducting user research, designing the user interface and interactions, and making sure the user experience was top-notch. To demonstrate and test the app's functionality, I also created a prototype. Finally, I documented everything the developers needed to build the final product.",

For example, misaligned mental models led to user friction when navigating the calendar, prompting me to investigate conventions that would enable friction-free date selection in my design. Additionally, participants had difficulty locating certain pieces of information such as the cancellation policy, which created hesitancy to follow through with booking and ultimately impeded conversion rates. To address these issues, I worked on improving the information architecture to make it more intuitive and user-friendly. By making these changes, we were able to create a more effective and efficient design that met the needs of our users.",
